## Information

### Advanced Technical Writing
This is about Advanced-Technical-Writing-Projects based on UMGC course and my inspirations for using the Steam's website. This is a project-based study of applied technical writing to design and develop appropriate and effective technical documents. Under the copyright and policies of intellectual property for UMGC, I will only upload items that do not have an answer key. If UMGC sees that I have uploaded something I should not, let me know and I'll remove it.


### Textbooks
- Technical Writing books that are on Google and Wikipedia.
